How to play:
1.) The first screen is where the player makes their code.  The code goes from top to bottom, so if you want the code "Red, Blue, Green, Yellow," then the code maker must click the top red box, the blue box in the row below the top, green in the next row, and yellow in the bottom row.  To start the game, just hit the button on the bottom.

2.) Upon start up, it will prompt you for logging.  If you do not want logging, just click "Cancel."  If you want to log, type in the file name you want and click "Ok."  If the file exists, it will prompt overwrite.  If you click "Yes," it will overwrite the existing file; if you click "No," it will send you back to the initial logging prompt; and if you press "Cancel," it will just cancel logging all together.  If you want to enable logging mid-game, just go to File -> Log.

3.) When the right-hand side is lit up with a variety of colors, it is the Codebreaker's turn, more specifically a human codebreaker.  To set a code, all the human codebreaker has to do is click on colors in a similar fashion as creating a code, clicking on colors from top to bottom and then clicking the "Submit code" button.

You can change the breaker type by going to Player option in the menu bar.  There are three player types for the codebreaker: Human, Simple, and Jedi.  For computers, under File -> Set Wait time, you can set the amount of thinking time.  The default is thirty seconds.

4.) After the codebreaker guesses, the codemaker must input a response.  On the right side, there will be three columns.  The left-most column is white, the response to a player guessing the right color in the wrong spot.  The middle column is light grey, which is for an incorrect color guess.  The right column is black, which represents a correct color in the correct spot.  Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the codebreaker guesses correctly or runs out of guesses.  You can start a new game at any time by going to File -> New Game.

While the game is in progress moves can be undone and redone. It is important to note that if a move is "Undone" before it is given feedback it cannot be "Redone". Furthermore, the AI that handles the Codebreaker can be changed during the middle of a game. Open the player menu to view these options.

5.) To exit the game, go to File -> Exit.
